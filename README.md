## Places scripts

This is a set of scripts that can be used with the Places Location service REST APIs. Currently, the set includes Python scripts that are used to import a set of POIs from a .csv file.

## Goals

The goal is to provide scripts that customers can use to enhance the bulk management of POIs in their Places database. However, the scripts **do not** replace the [Places UI](https://places.adobe.com) or the REST APIs.

### Installation

To install the scripts, download the repo to your local machine.

### Usage

The instructions about how to use the scripts are located in this [Readme](import/README.md) file.
